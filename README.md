## 2. Legal Procedures

### 2.1. Miranda Rights

These rights must be read to a suspect upon arrest.

**English:**
```
You have the right to remain silent. Anything you say can and will be used against you in a court of law. You have a right to an attorney. If you cannot afford an attorney, one will be appointed for you.
```

**Indonesian:**
```
Anda berhak untuk diam. Apapun yang Anda katakan dapat dan akan digunakan untuk melawan Anda di pengadilan. Anda berhak atas seorang pengacara. Jika Anda tidak mampu menyewa pengacara, seorang pengacara akan ditunjuk untuk Anda.
